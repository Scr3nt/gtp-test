# Publishing Your Website

For publishing your Next.js website, I recommend using Vercel.

### Installing Vercel

To get started, install the Vercel CLI globally by running:

```bash
npm install -g vercel@latest
```

### Deploying Your Website with Vercel

Once Vercel is installed, you can deploy your website using the following command:

```bash
vercel
```

Your website will be deployed on the Vercel platform, and you'll receive a unique URL for it.

### Vercel Configuration File

The `vercel.json` configuration file is already created when using Blitz. This file contains configuration settings for your Vercel deployment.

For more detailed information about deploying with Vercel, as well as other deployment solutions, you can refer to the following link: [Publish websites - Expo Documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/publishing-websites/)
