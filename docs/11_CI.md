# CI Testing Workflow for Pull Requests

You can find the file `.github/workflows/testing.yaml`, which will run ESLint tests as well as unit tests for each PR. Github Actions is used, but you can switch to CircleCI or other options if you prefer.

## E2E Tests Recommendation

Consider adding End-to-End (E2E) tests to ensure comprehensive testing of your application's functionality. You can find a helpful guide on setting up E2E tests with Github Actions [here](https://blog.mobile.dev/running-your-maestro-flows-on-github-actions-fe2e016b7338).

## Branch Protection

It is recommended to protect important branches, especially the main branch, to maintain code quality and security. Configure branch protection rules in your repository settings, enforcing status checks and code reviews before merging changes.
